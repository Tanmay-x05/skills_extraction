The Skill Extraction Project is an NLP-driven system that automatically identifies and extracts both technical and soft skills from unstructured text such as resumes, job descriptions, and professional profiles. By combining text preprocessing, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and machine learning models like spaCy and BERT, it delivers accurate and structured outputs in formats such as CSV or JSON. This enables applications in recruitment automation, jobâ€“skill matching, employee skill gap analysis, and workforce trend research, making it a valuable tool for HR, job portals, and organizational analytics.
